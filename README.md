ToolsQA is a platform where user can practice automation testing by accessing different elements. In this project I have written Test cases and Test scripts to evaluate the quality level of Student registration form & I have followed skills like Automation Testing, Selenium, Python, Pycharm, Unit Testing, System Testing, Black Box testing and STLC. I have utilized these skills to determine the quality level of the web application and to find bugs.
